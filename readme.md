## Cinema Seat Reservation System

This project aims to develop a user-friendly system for reserving multiple cinema seats without relying on external APIs. 

### Key Features

* **Multi-seat Selection:** Users can conveniently select multiple seats for a chosen movie showtime.
* **Seat Availability Tracking:** The system keeps real-time track of available seats, preventing double bookings.
* **User Interface:** An intuitive interface allows users to browse movies, view seat layouts, and finalize reservations.
* **Reservation Management:** Users can manage their existing reservations, including viewing details and making cancellations.


### Technical Approach

* **Data Storage:** Utilize a local database or a lightweight file-based system to store movie information, seat layouts, and reservation data.
* **User Interface Development:** Develop a user-friendly interface using a web framework, desktop application framework, or even a text-based console application.
* **Seat Selection Logic:** Implement logic to handle seat selection, including highlighting available seats, handling conflicts, and allowing contiguous seat selection.
* **Reservation Confirmation:** Integrate a confirmation system to ensure successful reservations and notify users.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle scenarios like invalid input, unavailable seats, or reservation conflicts.

**Note:** This is a lightweight solution without an external API. For a more feature-rich system, consider integrating with online ticketing platforms in the future.
